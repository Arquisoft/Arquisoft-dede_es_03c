== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]

Our goal is to have an online sales system called DeDe (Decentralized Delivery) that respects customer privacy by following SOLID principles.
As the SOLID principles say, the idea is that the information is not centralized and each user has their own storage, this is managed through the SOLID POD, so the user can authorize the entities that want to access their information. In the POD only the location of access to the information is saved, in the restapi we will save all the locations to these files.

| Technology | Explication |
| MongoDB | we will use it to store the location of the SOLID POD. |
| React | is a library to help us carry out the project. |
| TypeScript | is used for program. |
| Grafana and Prometeus | are used to monitor. |
| Postman | is used for testing. |
