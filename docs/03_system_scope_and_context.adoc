== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]

Our goal is to have an online sales system called DeDe (Decentralized Delivery), that respects customer privacy by following SOLID principles.
SOLID principles tell us that each user's personal information must be decentralised, and for this we use SOLID PODs.
SOLID PODs are stores of information outside our system.
In our system we only store the accesses to the PODs, in order to speed up the reading processes.
Users have control over who has their information, thus increasing privacy.

| Technology | Explication |
| MongoDB | We will use it to store the location of the SOLID POD |
| React | It is a library to help us carry out the project |
| TypeScript | It is used for program |
| Grafana and Prometeus | This is used to monitor |
| Postman | It is used for testing |
