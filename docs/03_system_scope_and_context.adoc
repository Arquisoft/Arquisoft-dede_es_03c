| Entity | Input | Output
| User | The user will interact with the application through a computer or other device. The user will see the frontend of the application and send requests to the backend | The output is represented in many parts of the system, reaching almost every point in the system
| User Pod | It creates new PODs for users who have not created them, can update the information contained in them, and also handles requests made to it by providing the requested information | Submit the information requested by the application 
| Hefesto System | It is the system with which the user interacts, it receives the requests sent by the user through the interface  | It processes incoming requests and manages the database so that it is consistent with incoming requests. Once it has the requested information, it shows it to the user via the interface

=== Technical Context

Our goal is to have an online sales system called DeDe (Decentralized Delivery), that respects customer privacy by following SOLID principles.
SOLID principles tell us that each user's personal information must be decentralised, and for this we use SOLID PODs.
SOLID PODs are stores of information outside our system.
In our system we only store the accesses to the PODs, in order to speed up the reading processes.
Users have control over who has their information, thus increasing privacy.
