=== 8.1 Domain model

=== 8.2. Persistence

At the beginning there was a debate about whether it was better to use SQL or NoSQL for persistence. After some discussion it was concluded that the best option for this problem is NoSQL. To be more specific MongoDB, which is a NoSQL document database. We will use a NoSQL database as opposed to a SQL database, because our model encompasses many products. These products have several attributes which are very different. For example, a power supply differs in many ways from a graphics card. Because there are so many items, we believe it is best to use a NoSQL DB.
