=== _8.3. User interface_

_DeDe user interface is desinged to give every user an intuitive and familiar experience related using the React framework combined with TypeScript as constraints. We follow the usual standards of e-commerce online sites to make the navigation closer to what most of the people already know. Also, the interface is meant to pass the AAA validation so we make sure it's usable for almost everyone_
