== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== 8.3. Internazionalization

The application will potentially deal with various locations and people, so make a multi-languaje application looks like the best decision. This decision must be done since the begining of the desing (lately will cost a lot of resources).

This allows us to reach a bigger audience and make the application more accesible.


=== 8.4. Security

Security is a key aspect of our software (and almost all) project. We will follow SOLID as recommendation to store our customers data and we will manage the data base to be always in a consistent state.


=== 8.5. Additional libraries

=== 8.6. Archiutecture and design patterns

=== 8.7 Code Quality standards

Code quality standars allows us to make an understable, maintainable and reusable code for future revisions and changes. Code should always have a correct structure to be easily understandable.

To achieve this we will use all tools programs give us and make correct decisions like design patters, use convention naming and try to reduce technical debt.

=== 8.8. Testability

Applications should be strongly tested. We will use user histories to make acceptance tests and unit test to test the rest of the application components and states during running process.

We think this is the best way to be sure the project works correctly.
