== Design Decisions

|===
|Decision|Details|Advantages|Disadvantages
|Internazionalization|We will develop the documentation in english and the application in english and spanish|With this internazionalization we improve accesibility a lot|Time can be a factor to consider and make two language internazionalization can use a lot of time
|Design architecture|We will use MVC as architectural pattern for backend and Redux for frontend|With MVC we have better usability and a very organized and understable code. Redux helps us with data synchrony|MVC: We need to structure the code perfectly to comply with the convention. Redux: We never used it
|Frameworks|We will choose Redux framework to develop application frontend|We can use it to facilitate the implementation|Is a new technology to us so we need to improve our knowledge about it
|Data Base|We choosed MongoDB to store all the information|MongoDB allows us to make an easier implementation|Is a new technology to us so we need to improbe our kownledge about it
|Save images|We have decided to store all images related to the product catalogue in an external API called Cloudiary|With this we manage to decentralise the images of the project, the favourable implications are many, from increasing security, such as lightening the weight of the project by not having to save the images, also highlighting the ease of displaying them as it works through a URL saved in the product|The disadvantages are having to configure the entire API, the fact that the products have to save a URL increases its complexity, we depend on this external API for the correct functioning of the application
|Hexagonal architecture|We will use MVC as architectural pattern for backend and Redux for frontend|With MVC we have better usability and a very organized and understable code. Redux helps us with data synchrony|MVC: We need to structure the code perfectly to comply with the convention. Redux: We never used it
|Docker Database|We will choose Redux framework to develop application frontend|We can use it to facilitate the implementation|Is a new technology to us so we need to improve our knowledge about it
|Seeding the database in Docker|We choosed MongoDB to store all the information|MongoDB allows us to make an easier implementation|Is a new technology to us so we need to improbe our kownledge about it
|API lasod to calculate delivery price|We choosed MongoDB to store all the information|MongoDB allows us to make an easier implementation|Is a new technology to us so we need to improbe our kownledge about it
|Various databases for tests|We have decided to store all images related to the product catalogue in an external API called Cloudiary|With this we manage to decentralise the images of the project, the favourable implications are many, from increasing security, such as lightening the weight of the project by not having to save the images, also highlighting the ease of displaying them as it works through a URL saved in the product|The disadvantages are having to configure the entire API, the fact that the products have to save a URL increases its complexity, we depend on this external API for the correct functioning of the application
|MUI|We will use MVC as architectural pattern for backend and Redux for frontend|With MVC we have better usability and a very organized and understable code. Redux helps us with data synchrony|MVC: We need to structure the code perfectly to comply with the convention. Redux: We never used it
|ASW|We will choose Redux framework to develop application frontend|We can use it to facilitate the implementation|Is a new technology to us so we need to improve our knowledge about it
|PBKDF2|We choosed MongoDB to store all the information|MongoDB allows us to make an easier implementation|Is a new technology to us so we need to improbe our kownledge about it
|Login to SOLID POD|We choosed MongoDB to store all the information|MongoDB allows us to make an easier implementation|Is a new technology to us so we need to improbe our kownledge about it
|Bootstrap|We choosed MongoDB to store all the information|MongoDB allows us to make an easier implementation|Is a new technology to us so we need to improbe our kownledge about it
|Bootswatch|We have decided to store all images related to the product catalogue in an external API called Cloudiary|With this we manage to decentralise the images of the project, the favourable implications are many, from increasing security, such as lightening the weight of the project by not having to save the images, also highlighting the ease of displaying them as it works through a URL saved in the product|The disadvantages are having to configure the entire API, the fact that the products have to save a URL increases its complexity, we depend on this external API for the correct functioning of the application
|SweetAlert2|We will use MVC as architectural pattern for backend and Redux for frontend|With MVC we have better usability and a very organized and understable code. Redux helps us with data synchrony|MVC: We need to structure the code perfectly to comply with the convention. Redux: We never used it
